# Apalikulindacore as a method, label, and research system

## Overview
Apalikulindacore is a multifaceted system encompassing a creative label, a prompting approach, and a method for exploring cyber-utopian aesthetics in Midjourney generations. It integrates experimentation with AI artefacts, self-imposed constraints, and a poetic approach to digital imagery.
Apalikulindacore also involves iterative prompt experimentation, adjusting detail, atmosphere, and parameters to explore AI behaviour, while maintaining a non-commercial, personal creative focus.


## Purpose
- Study AI-generated artefacts and the creative potential of prompts
- Explore unique aesthetics and cyber-utopian worlds
- Combine creative exploration with systematic observation
