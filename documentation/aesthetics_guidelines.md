 # Aesthetics Guidelines

## Cyber-Utopian Universe
- Characters: robots, dinosaurs, unicorns, hybrid creatures, roboticized versions of imaginary beings
- All creatures exist in a fictional world with its own anatomy and laws of physics
- Often, robotic creatures merge with nature and plants, showing symbiosis and interaction

## Atmosphere and Mood
- Healing, holistic vibe
- Technology reveres nature, and nature heals technology
- Emphasis on synergy and harmony
- Poetic, calm, and peaceful atmosphere
- Typical color palettes avoid yellow, beige, and brown (personal aesthetic preference)

## Composition and Themes
- Freedom for AI to explore combinations and arrangements
- No fixed narrative required, but interactions between creatures and nature are common
- No restrictions on perspective or detail level

## Style Constraints
- Avoid photorealistic humans
- Do not use names of artists, studios, or existing works as references
- Maintain a calm, friendly, and peaceful tone
- No horror, weapons, or sexualization of characters
- Occasionally, AI may generate sexualized robots, dinosaurs, or unicorns; such outputs are excluded from the portfolio
- Use prompts to guide outputs toward desired aesthetic while allowing for AI creativity

## Visual Elements
- Focus on textures, atmosphere, and harmonious color combinations
- Specific details, patterns, and prompt-based variations are tracked separately in prompt notes
