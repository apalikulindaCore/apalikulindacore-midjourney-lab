# Prompt Principles

## Approach
- Adding "apalikulindacore" to prompts as a digital signature
- Avoiding photorealistic humans and commercial styles
- Avoiding artist names, studio names, or existing works as references
- Using previous own generations as visual reference points
- Experimenting with atmosphere, composition, textures, and narrative elements
- Applying self-imposed constraints to guide creative exploration
- Emphasising digital poetics and poetic atmosphere in AI outputs

## Observations
- Notes on variations between prompts and resulting outputs
- How AI artefacts, distortions, and hallucinations contribute to aesthetics
- Patterns and unexpected behaviours arising from constraints
- Effects of repeating or modifying certain keywords, including "apalikulindacore"
- How prompts shape the balance between creative exploration and systematic observation
- Reflections on creative decisions and aesthetic outcomes
